This paper was valuable to me in learning about techniques for Card Game AI:

Kupferschmid, S., Helmert, M. (2007). A Skat Player Based on Monte-Carlo Simulation. In: van den Herik,

I used these websites to learn about the Monte Carlo Search Tree algorithm, get inspiration, and check my work:

Implementation based on GeeksForGeeks: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-monte-carlo-tree-search-mcts/

This page was helpful as well: https://towardsdatascience.com/monte-carlo-tree-search-an-introduction-503d8c04e168

I used this to compare a Python implementation of MCST: https://ai-boson.github.io/mcts/

As well as this implementation made specifically for Connect 4: https://www.harrycodes.com/blog/monte-carlo-tree-search
I used this one as a template for my Ninety Nine version

This last implementation was invaluable to me for testing and learning about the algorithm

ChatGPT was a helpful tool for the development process
