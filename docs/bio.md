I am a recent graduate of California State University Channel Islands,
from which I earned my B.S. in Computer Science. Aside from creating this Capstone project,
I was also one of the key contributors on the semester project "Barter Buddy."

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, reading, and listening to podcasts and alternative rock.
