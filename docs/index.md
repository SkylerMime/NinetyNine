# About

Ninety-Nine Pygame is a computer implementation of the card game [Ninety-Nine](https://www.parlettgames.uk/oricards/ninety9.html), invented by [David Parlett](https://parlettgames.uk/).
My project includes a GUI created with the Pygame library, and an optional AI opponent.

This was created as part of my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. Thanks to Professors Michael Soltys and Reza Abdolee for advising.
